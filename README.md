# Building-a-rat-detector-Computer-Vision-Grounding-DINO-and-YOLOv10
This is part of a project from IE University. It contains a notebook that walks you through creating a model for predicting rats on images using Computer Vision. It has two steps: Automatic annotation with Grounding DINO and Building the model with YOLOv10. We will leverage on Ultralytics and Roboflow platform
